## Computational Tools for Biologists

**11 Nov, 09:00 – 15 Nov, 17:00**

**Casa Morgado Esporão, R. de Dona Isabel 6, 7000-880 Évora, Portugal**

### General goals for the class

- Learn how to automate analysis of biological data
- Program in different languages
- Integrate different tools into coherent "pipelines"
- Find out about tools that you didn't consider before
- Jumpstart the learning of anything computer-related

### Method

- Lecture notes/book
- Exercises in class and homework
- You need to include these tools into your daily work to be effective
- "Showcase" more than "Teach"
- Give practical examples
- Brief review of the chapter(s) 
- Warmup exercises
- Working as a group to solve the longer exercises at the end of the chapter

### Before we start

#### Installation

#### Getting data and code

- Open a terminal (`Ctrl + Alt + T` in Ubuntu)
- Clone the repository for the book

```
git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
```

- Clone the repository for the exercises and summaries

```
git clone https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/evora.git
```

### UNIX Shell

- [Lecture notes and warmup](notes/ch1)

### Programming in Python

- [Basic Programming](notes/ch3)
- [Advanced Programming](notes/ch4)
- [Regular Expressions](notes/ch5)
- [Scientific Programming](notes/ch6)
- [Python Wrapup](notes/phyton_wrapup)

### Programming in R

- [Basic R](notes/ch8)
- [Wrangling and visualization](notes/ch9)
- [R wrapup](notes/r_wrapup)

## Conclusion
I hope the class helped building your confidence when it comes to computing. You should feel empowered: with a little time and dedication, you can crack almost any computational problem.

The real power is to be able to combine creatively the different tools we've seen in class: maybe some shell scripting can save you some time when wrestling with a large data set, which can then be parsed and analyzed in Python and plotted in R.

The only way to become a strong programmer is to program a lot. Force yourself to tackle new problems; ask for help; learn from your mistakes and from others; it is a neverending journey, but a rewarding one.

If you can automate something, do it. 

There are many other topics that you might find interesting. See the last chapter for some suggestions.

If you are about to embark on a difficult project, and you need a sounding board or some advice, come see me and I'll buy you an espresso.

Thanks for the great time in class, and happy computing!
Stefano
